<h1>Alarm Clock for Synology</h1>

<p>This program turns your <strong>Synology DiskStation</strong> into an intelligent music alarm clock.
At the appointed time, you will be awakened by the gentle sounds of your favorite melody.</p>

<p>You can choose to play any playlist from configured in <strong>AudioStation</strong>, or created specifically for this purpose.</p>

<p>Music can play through a connected to
DiskStation USB sound card or speakers, as well as any available in
AudioStation network player by <strong>DLNA</strong> or <strong>AirPlay</strong> protocol.</p>

<p>You can set different ringtones to different days of week, and set multiple alarms for different players. For
example, early in the morning on weekdays in your room through the connected speakers, and a bit later - on a network player in the
nursery for a child. Moreover, at the weekend - set alarm clock to a later time.</p>

<p>For each alarm clock, the play time is set.</p>

<p>You can adjust the fade playback to your awakening was more pleasant.</p>


<h2>Main settings</h2>

account with rights for adding tasks to the built-in scheduler. For example, it may be the system administrator account.</p>
